# Gem5 Simulation Project: CPU and Cache Architecture Exploration

## Project Overview
This project documents my successful setup of the Gem5 simulator and a series of controlled experiments to analyze the impact of key architectural parameters on system performance.

## Technical Journey
Successfully deployed Gem5 after evaluating multiple platforms, resolving dependency conflicts and compilation challenges.

## Experiments
- **CPU Comparison:** AtomicSimpleCPU vs TimingSimpleCPU
- **Cache Analysis:** L1 cache size impact on performance

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Gem5 configuration and simulation
- Computer architecture analysis
- Cross-platform problem solving
